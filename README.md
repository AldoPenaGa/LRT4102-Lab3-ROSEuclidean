### Introduction


### Problems
There were four tasks to be solved:

1- Calculate and display on the screen DTG (distance to go) and ATG (angle to go).
2- Spawn the robot, using services, at the goal position. (not moving, just spawning).
3- Explain the velocities mapping.
4- Use a free control system (P, I, D, or a combination) to move the turtle to the desired position in infinite loop.


### Codes

This time, the python scripts are all included in the ROS package called lab03.



### Conclusion

To summarize, this laboratory report has provided an extensive review of ROS, from the basics of developing a ROS package to some advanced implementation of a PID controller. The journey through the challenges and codes has not only strengthened our comprehension of ROS communication system, but has also demonstrated the integration of theory and practice. As we conclude, we consider the impact of ROS and PID control on the future of robotic system design, leaving us encouraged and equipped with the tools to innovate in the field of robotics.
